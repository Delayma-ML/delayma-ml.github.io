## Motivation

Flight delays have long been a centre of uncertainty in the aviation industry, having widespread effects on the aviation industry and passengers. It is a critical concern within the aviation industry, impacting passenger satisfaction, operational costs, and overall system efficiency. Prediction of delay can have far-reaching consequences on the entire industry and is of huge economic importance.

Accurately predicting flight delays is a crucial point of research as it is affected by various factors such as-weather, air traffic congestion, logistic complexities, festivities, and economics. Developing reliable prediction models can revolutionize how airlines manage their schedules and passengers plan their journeys. This study aimed at creating a modern ML model which can accurately predict delays based on- season, time, location, etc. For this study, we used various datasets and intend to employ relevant ML algorithms to correctly predict delays, coupled with relevant visualization analysis and data engineering techniques.

## Related Work

Several attempts have been made before to predict flight delays.

- **Jia Yi and team**[^1] developed a classifier where a delay is defined as an arrival or departure that is 15 minutes later than scheduled. They utilized a two-layer stacking algorithm. The first layer learners comprised of KNN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Gaussian Naive Bayes, while the second layer learner was a Logistic Regression model. For feature selection, they employed the Boruta algorithm. The stacking algorithm surpassed all single-level learners in performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The Random Forest classifiers were the closest in performance to the stacking algorithm among all the algorithms. The classifier achieved an accuracy of 0.82 with the stacking algorithm.

- **Esmaeilzadeh and Mokhtarimousavi**[^2] conducted an experiment using Support Vector Machines to investigate the non-linear correlation between instances of flight delays. Their study was limited to a 20-day period in 2018 and focused on three major airports in New York City. Their research indicated that elements such as pushback delay, taxi-out delay, the ground delay program, and demand-capacity imbalance, with respective probabilities of 0.506, 0.478, 0.339, and 0.338, have a significant impact on the delay of flight departures.

- **Zhang and Ma**[^3] undertook a project to categorize flight departure delays into three distinct groups: under 15 minutes, between 15 and 60 minutes, and over 60 minutes. They combined a flight dataset with a weather dataset, resulting in a total of 260k samples. The selection of features was done manually. They applied the CatBoost algorithm, a method that leverages gradient boosting on decision trees. The learning process was executed on the GPU, while the scoring algorithm was run on the CPU. The model's accuracy was recorded at 0.77.

- **Tang**[^4] tried to classify flights into two categories: delayed (if the departure was delayed by 15 minutes or more) and on-time. The data used for this project was collected from JFK Airport over the period of November 2019 to December 2020. A variety of machine learning algorithms were tested using tenfold cross-validation, including Logistic Regression, KNN, Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Trees, SVM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Trees, all with their default parameters from scikit-learn. The Decision Trees algorithm emerged as the top performer, achieving an accuracy of 0.977, closely followed by Gradient Boosted Trees.

## Dataset Details

The dataset source is taken from a [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/threnjen/2019-airline-delays-and-cancellations), which contains information about flights that took off from JFK Airport between November 2019 and January 2020.

### Insights from the dataset

- Except for a handful of anomalies, there doesn't appear to be a significant relationship between distance and delay.

![delay_vs_dist](images/delay_vs_dist.png)

- Upon examining the most frequently visited destination states, we find California, Florida, and New York at the top of the list. This aligns with the fact that these states are among the most populated in the U.S. Interestingly, despite being located across the country, the two most popular destinations are both in California.

![dest_states](images/dest_airports.png)

- Severe weather circumstances, such as exceptionally high or low temperatures, can lead to flight delays. This is understandable, as such extreme weather can pose challenges for both the aircraft and the airport operations.

![temp_vs_delay](images/temp_vs_delay.png)

- Despite our initial suggestion that there might be a connection between temperature and delay, the correlation is not particularly robust. Indeed, the relationship between any weather condition and delay is relatively weak.

### How we used the dataset

The `DEP_DELAY` column in the datasets used for Classification was transformed into binary classes. A flight was marked as delayed if the departure time was more than 15 minutes later than scheduled.

In order to make the classification task more manageable, we started with a smaller subset of the problem before expanding to the larger one. To proceed, four sub-datasets were created from this.

- **df_1_3** - Dataset with top 3 most frequent destinations.
- **df_1_10** - Dataset with top 10 most frequent destinations.
- **df_1_25** - Dataset with top 25 most frequent destinations.
- **df_preprocessed** - Dataset with all destinations.

In the context of the regression problem, the `DEP_DELAY` column was utilized in its original form.

- **m1_final_regression_dataset** - Dataset with all destinations for regression.

## Data Pre-processing

Basic preprocessing, which was done on the complete dataset:

1. The `Condition` attribute originally contained 25 unique conditions. Some data entries had multiple conditions listed in the `Condition` field. We first carried out an encoding process akin to label encoding, but in a monotonically increasing manner. For instance, various types of cloudiness like _mostly cloudy_ and _partly cloudy_ were assigned the numbers 2 and 1, respectively. Each condition was allocated its own column, leading to the creation of 9 additional columns and the removal of the original `Condition` column.

2. Attributes such as day, month, hour, and minute exhibit cyclical behavior. To capture this periodicity, we employ a technique known as **cyclic feature engineering**. This method involves mapping each cyclical attribute onto a circle, ensuring the preservation of its periodic characteristics. As a result, we applied cyclic feature engineering to the `MONTH`, `DAY_OF_WEEK`, and `DAY_OF_MONTH` columns.

In order to streamline the problem-solving process, we strategically chose to tackle a less complex subset of the problem initially. This approach allowed us to gradually scale up our efforts. Consequently, we partitioned the original dataset into four distinct, manageable sub-datasets.

Datasets used for Classification had their `DEP_DELAY` column converted to binary classes based on delay, where delay is true if the departure time delay exceeds 15 minutes.

The attributes `MONTH`, `DAY_OF_MONTH`, and `DAY_OF_WEEK` underwent a transformation into sine and cosine values to encapsulate their cyclical nature. The attributes `Temperature`, `Dew Point`, `Wind`, and `Condition` were converted into numerical representations. As part of the preprocessing phase, new columns such as `Cloudy`, `Windy`, `Fair`, `Rain`, `Fog`, `Drizzle`, `Snow`, `Wintry Mix`, and `Freezing Rain` were introduced into the dataset. Subsequently, the original columns `MONTH`, `DAY_OF_MONTH`, `DAY_OF_WEEK`, and Condition were removed from the dataset.

## Methodology

### Baseline for classification

We have successfully replicated the results from previous studies, utilizing the same algorithms to establish a baseline. To address the significant class imbalance in our preprocessed data, we employed the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). This technique leverages the KNN algorithm to synthesize samples from minority classes. After mitigating the class imbalance, we partitioned the data into an 80:20 split and performed scaling. Subsequently, we used the Boruta algorithm, a sophisticated feature selection method that uses Random Forests, to select the most relevant features. The Random Forest model yielded the highest scores, as detailed below:

### Classification

We used mutiple algorithms for multiple datasets and compared their performance.

The models were evaluated using key metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

### Regression

After getting more that 97% accuracy in classification, we moved on to regression. We did regression on the entire dataset.

We initially used the following algorithms and did hyperparameter tuning on them without removing outliers:

| Model                 | Hyperparameters                              | MSE                    | Standard Deviation | R2 Score           |

Our model is yielding a low Mean Squared Error (MSE) and a high R2 score, which are positive indicators. However, the high standard deviation suggests the presence of outliers in our dataset. To address this, we employed the z-score method with a threshold of 3.0 to identify and remove these outliers. The results post outlier removal are as follows:

| Model                 | Hyperparameters                              | MSE                    | Standard Deviation | R2 Score            |

The results reveal a substantial reduction in the standard deviation, with the exception of Logistic Regression. This is primarily due to the fact that Logistic Regression is not ideally suited for regression tasks. Furthermore, there's a notable decrease in the Mean Squared Error (MSE), indicating improved model performance. The R2 score has also seen a significant increase, nearing the optimal value of 1.0. This improvement can be attributed to the removal of outliers that were previously skewing the R2 score. Overall, these results suggest that our model is performing exceptionally well.

## Conclusion and Future Work

Our findings suggest that we have successfully fine-tuned a Bayesian Ridge Regression model to accurately predict flight delays. This model can be utilized to anticipate delays and implement preventative measures. While the model has performed well on our dataset, testing it on larger, real-time datasets would be a more complex and challenging task. Real-time data often contains incomplete information, resulting in numerous empty fields that need to be handled. Despite these challenges, the potential benefits are significant. For instance, these predictive models could be used to notify passengers about delays in advance, allowing them to adjust their travel plans accordingly.
